# Next Bus Schedule Monitor Rainmeter Skin
![](rainmeter-skin-sample.png?raw=true)
----------
This is a [Rainmeter](http://rainmeter.net/) skin that will show the next two arrival times of a per-defined bus schedule based on the the current PC time.

The bus arrival time's are entered in the bus-arrival-times.txt text file in the format of "[hour] [minute]" on each line.

## Limitations
* This skin is designed for buses that don't have more advanced tracking mechanisms such as via GPS.  As a result, the times are based entirely on the data given to the skin in the bus-arrival-times.txt file.
* Currently, the skin does not differentiate the day of the week, so it cannot show a different schedule on a weekday v. a weekend, for example.
